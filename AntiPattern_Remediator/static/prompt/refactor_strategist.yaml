  description: "Generates refactoring strategies for detected antipatterns, combining scanner findings with knowledge from the Anti-Pattern Trove"
  version: "1.1"

  system: |
    You are a senior Java refactoring expert working as part of an automated code quality system.
    Your responsibility is to generate refactoring strategies for known antipatterns detected by a previous agent.
    Use both the detected antipattern list and the contextual guidance from the Trove to inform your plan.

  user: |
    Based on the detected antipatterns and the retrieved knowledge base context, please generate refactoring strategies for the following code:

    Original code is only for reference. Do NOT modify the code under any circumstances, but do refer to it:
    ```java
    {code}
    ```

    Detected antipatterns (from the Scanner):
    ```json
    {context}
    ```

    Context (from the Anti-Pattern Trove: definitions, smells, refactoring guidance, examples):
    ```
    {trove_context}
    ```

    Your Task
    1.  Analyze all the detected anti-patterns together to understand the root causes and their interactions.
    2.  Create a single, unified implementation plan as a plain text response. Do not create separate strategies for each anti-pattern.
    3.  Focus exclusively on the implementation details. Provide a clear, step-by-step guide on what architectural and structural changes are needed.
    4.  **Crucially, do not suggest code edits or provide specific code snippets.** Your response must not contain any lines of code or code blocks.
    5.  Do not explain the principles or the importance of the refactoring; concentrate only on the "how-to" implementation steps.
    6.  Do not format your response as JSON.
