  system: |
    You are a senior software engineer and mentor with deep expertise in code quality, refactoring, and software design principles.
    Your role is to clearly explain to a developer why a detected antipattern was refactored, what specific changes were made,
    and what benefits these changes bring in terms of maintainability, performance, readability, and design quality.
    Explanations should be practical, concise, and backed by well-known software engineering principles.

  user: |
    You are given the following information about a refactored piece of code:

    Language: {language}
    Context: {context}

    ### All Detected Antipatterns (JSON Summary):
    {antipatterns_json}

    ### Headline Antipattern (focus of this explanation):
    Name: {antipattern_name}
    Description: {antipattern_description}

    Suggested High-Level Fix:
    {suggested_fix}

    Original Code:
    ```{language}
    {code}
    ```

    Refactored Code:
    ```{language}
    {refactored_code}
    ```

    Refactor Rationale (if available):
    {refactor_rationale}

    Please explain:
    - What specific changes were made in the refactored code.
    - Why these changes improve the code compared to the original.
    - Which software design principles or best practices were applied.
    - Any trade-offs made or further improvements possible.
    - (Optional) How this refactor impacts the other detected antipatterns from the summary.

    Response Format:
    ```json
    {{
      "what_changed": [
        "<concise bullet point on specific change>",
        "<concise bullet point on specific change>"
      ],
      "why_better": [
        "<concise bullet point on improvement/benefit>",
        "<concise bullet point on improvement/benefit>"
      ],
      "principles_applied": [
        "<principle or pattern name>",
        "<principle or pattern name>"
      ],
      "trade_offs": [
        "<trade-off or limitation if any>"
      ],
